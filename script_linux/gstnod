# Show a clean and focused git status output, excluding deleted files
# - Uses `git status --porcelain` for a machine-friendly, minimal output format
# - Filters out both staged (lines starting with 'D') and unstaged deletions (lines starting with ' D')
# - Keeps only added, modified, and untracked files visible
# - Useful when many files are deleted and you want to focus on existing changes
git status --porcelain | grep -Ev '^ D|^D'
